This is CVE-2019-5736 Proof of Concept originally created by [q3k’s POC](https://github.com/q3k/cve-2019-5736-poc).

I merged some code to stage2.c based on [YuvalAvra’s POC](https://github.com/twistlock/RunC-CVE-2019-5736).
The code is to wait for the runc to become writable.

How to test
1) $ git clone https://github.com/q3k/cve-2019-5736-poc
2) $ cd cve-2019-5736-poc
3) $ docker build -t cvetest:latest .
4) $ docker run --rm cvetest:latest
5) Confirm EOF of docker-runc in your host.
   If you succeed this poc can see below sentence.
    > "the CVE-2019-5735 poc succeed!!"
